### About VS Code

VS Code it's a very, very popular text editor (seriously, who doesn't have heard of it?!?) developed by Microsoft. :scream: (THAT'S RIGTH!!, BILL GATES MOTHERF*#3RS!!!)

Visual Studio Code was announced on April 29, 2015.

This are the numbers in the GitHub at the moment of writing this:

As you can see, it's very popular.:blue_heart:


Well, enought advertising, let's get to the point.

**Plugins, plugins, plugins!!** :raised_hands:


## Debugger for Chrome
The first one (of curse) is debugger for Chrome, "Debug your JavaScript code running in Google Chrome from VS Code."

The extension operates in two modes - it can launch an instance of Chrome navigated to your app, or it can attach to a running instance of Chrome.
