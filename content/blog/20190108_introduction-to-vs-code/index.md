### About VS Code

VS Code it's a very, very popular text editor (seriously, who doesn't have heard of it?!?) developed by Microsoft. :scream: (THAT'S RIGTH!!, BILL GATES MOTHERF*#3RS!!!)

Visual Studio Code was announced on April 29, 2015.

Well, enought advertising, let's get to the point.


## What makes VS Code so popular?
- Comes with Integrated Terminal

- You can save many Code snipets
- You can add a lot of custom Themes
- All the extensions you can download!


**Extensions, extensions, extensions!!** :raised_hands:


## Debugger for Chrome
The first one (of curse) is debugger for Chrome, "Debug your JavaScript code running in Google Chrome from VS Code."

The extension operates in two modes - it can launch an instance of Chrome navigated to your app, or it can attach to a running instance of Chrome.

## Bracket Pair Colorizer
Another very usefull plugin, this extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours.:rainbow: 
The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use.
