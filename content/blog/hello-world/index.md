Hello world!! :raised_hands: 

This is my first post on my brand new Gatsby blog! :purple_heart:

I'll be writing about any random thing that comes to my mind :smile: (Mostly programming stuff).

But first, let me talk a little about myself...

My name is **Luis Duenas**, i'm a software developer :muscle:, i'm from Mexico.

I have 2 dogs :dog:, a cat :pouting_cat: and beautiful wife :couple_with_heart: who also is a software developer!

I'm currently working but i like a lot to dig in github and find some projects to contribute in my spare time.

I love to cook, i was a chef for 7 years before i became a developer.


Things i like:
- Minimalistic desings :star:
- Automation :zap:
- Write code :computer:
- Ask a lot of questions :sweat_smile:

I also like reading a lot of blog post about programming, productivity, and inspirational.
